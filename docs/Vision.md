## Business Requirements

- Upload slide decks
- Mark rounds in the deck and demarcate questions and answers within the deck
- Allow participants to form teams
- Show question units to the participant with realtime control by the host
- Allow participants to discuss answers and answer questions as a team

## Scope

There are a huge variety of quizzes and rounds in them. People also customise their slide decks in various different ways. This solution aims to be Pareto-optimal (create the 20% of the features that 80% of the users need) and only supports the common Pounce/Bounce style.
